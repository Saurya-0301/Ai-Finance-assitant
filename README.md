# AI Finance Assistant

## Overview
AI Finance Assistant is a learning-focused project that demonstrates how artificial intelligence concepts can be applied to the domain of personal finance. The system is designed to assist users by providing basic financial insights, explanations, and guidance through AI-driven logic and prompt-based responses.  

The project emphasizes clarity, usability, and responsible financial interpretation rather than complex financial modeling, making it suitable for beginner and intermediate AI learners.
